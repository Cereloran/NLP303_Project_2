### Summary
This project focuses on understanding and utilizing transformer models in NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. Transformer models, such as those from Hugging Face, have become essential in NLP due to their ability to handle complex language tasks more effectively than previous models.

### Key Points:
1. **Importance of Transformers**: Transformers are now the standard for NLP tasks, replacing older models like recurrent and convolutional neural networks.
2. **Project Goals**:
   - Gain hands-on experience with pre-trained transformer models.
   - Understand the variety of models available through Hugging Face.
   - Develop skills to acquire and use pre-trained models for typical NLP tasks.

### Instructions:
1. **Abstract**: Write a concise abstract (150 words or less) summarizing your project.
2. **Problem Statement**: Identify the problem or area of interest motivating your project.
3. **Architecture**: Describe the transformer-based architecture you will use (e.g., encoder-decoder attention).
4. **Background Literature**: Review relevant literature and available source code.
5. **Value Addition**: Explain how your group will add value to existing code and data.
6. **Datasets**: Specify the datasets you will use, including how you will split them for training, development, and testing.
7. **Evaluation Metrics**: Define qualitative and quantitative metrics for evaluating your system (e.g., ROGUE scores, attention plots).
8. **Project Plan**: Outline your project plan, including work breakdown, key milestones, and responsibilities.

### Useful Resources:
- **NLP Datasets**: GitHub, Hugging Face Datasets Hub, Wikipedia text data.
- **Research Papers**: Association for Computational Linguistics Anthology, arXiv.
- **Online Communities**: Stack Overflow, Reddit, Quora, Hugging Face forums.
